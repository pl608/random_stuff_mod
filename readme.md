# Random Stuff Mod
adds 3 usable items along with a few more items used exclusively for crafting
### Usable Nodes/Wearables
* Bright Water (random_stuff:bright_water), a water-like node that is set to the max light output. You cant drown in it, has 0 viscosity and has the same spread as lava.
* Wings (3d_armor:wings), a power-up that utilizes the 3d_armor mod to give you reduced gravity and an immortal health status. Downside is that to craft it you need an item rarer then diamonds or mese.
* Spring Boots (3d_armor:spring_boots) also uses the 3d_armor mod to let you jump super high and increases your speed. This bit of armor is equivalent to bronze in its strength and is a lot easier to craft the the wings. Beware of using this with wings though... undesired results may occur(reverse meteor)
### Crafting Items
* Weird Soul Thing(random_stuff:soul) This very creatively named item is used soully for crafting wings. It is found only in The Sole Stone ore block that is naturally occurring but rather rare
* The Sole Stone(random_stuff:stone_with_soul) A naturally occurring ore stone that contains a soul for crafting wings. The texture was made from the Soul Thing with the alpha set from mese ore... looks odd though.
* Springs(For Bouncy Things) (random_stuff:springs) crafted itself from 3 steel ingots this is used in conjunction with steel boots to make spring boots.
